### Hi there, I'm Miguel ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Scientist with a background in sales, marketing and insurance. Arizona born and raised. Don't love the 999-degree temperatures but do love the culture, people and great food. I've worked with insurance products in all 50 states and have met a ton of amazing people along the way. 

In one way or another - data ran my life so I decided to jump head first into the tech industry. I'm interested in all things machine learning, web development, app development and ultimately leveraging technology to make the world a better place.
